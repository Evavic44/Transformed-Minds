<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>Transformed Minds is an initiative aimed at helping individuals struggling with addictions. The gospel of Jesus Christ will only be internalised when the mind is fully prepared to receive it.
The mind of a believer must be devoid of blemishes, and this initiative is targeted at improving the spiritual lives of Christians through the gospel of Jesus.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Transfromed Minds, through the virtual and physical platforms available, 
will connect struggling Christians with the ones already mature in faith. 
This connection is aimed at fostering collective growth and ease in the 
practice of the Christian faith. As Christians, we are saddled with the 
responsibility of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, settling the captives 
free, and helping as many as possible. This initiative is not meant for just a select group of people. 
Christians all over the world are free to join in through fasting and prayers.</p>
